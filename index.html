                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a father to two amazing little boys and they've made life the best adventure possible. <br>
                    I try to make the most of my spare time. Weather permitting, I can usually be found at the coast
                    climbing sea cliffs or out trekking up a mountain in North Wales. When it's wet outside you'll find
                    me at an indoor climbing wall getting some practice in for when the sun comes back out. <br>
                    Take a 10 minute stroll from our house, over the river Avon, and you'll end up at our family
                    allotment full of homegrown fruit and veg. The kids love it here and they instantly become free
                    range!

                <h3>Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    Over the past year, I've been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride, with minimal coding experience (some HTML and CSS around 20 years ago); it's been a brilliant journey so far. <br>
                    A little confused at where to start, I began learning Python with the intention of becoming a Software Engineer but as part of this a course I was doing involved making a small web app and I was hooked instantly. Turns out Web Development is the career for me! <br>
                    Since then, I have undertaken multiple courses and challenges trying to absorb everything Front and Back-end that I can. So far I have started learning: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and some Node.js. Alongside this I have also used Frameworks including Bootstrap, Jquery and ExpressJS. <br>
                    Of course, there's no point becoming a Developer without ditching the Windows GUI so I've tried to master the Command Line Interface, as well as getting familiar with version control using both Git and GitHub.

                    <h3>Career</h3>
                    <p>After 18 successful years as a Plumbing & Heating Engineer, I have taken the first step toward
                        fulfilling my lifelong dream of working in Tech. <br>
                        Since March 2020, I have been studying Front & Back-End Development and, as of January 2021, I have been gaining work experience with a Web Development company, working at their office every Friday.  <br>
                        My ultimate goal is to be employed as a Full Stack Developer, working within a friendly, fun
                        team for a forward thinking company where my work would make an impact to the success of the
                        business.

                    <br> This is showcasing a sign up form I have created with NodeJS and ExpressJS, it connects to the

                    The form is live so I will recieve any details you fill. The app is deployed through Heroku.
                    Sadly I don't have a newsletter so if you do fill in the form maybe leave a fake email address!

                <p class="project-text">
                    <br> This was a project I decided to do to show off some JavaScript skills as well as use of media
                    breakpoints.
                    <br>For this to work I created a random number generator for each player, I then assigned Rock,
                    Paper and Scissors with the numbers 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Next, I used some logic to determin who
                    won, ie, 1 (Rock) beats 3 (Scissors). I used Javascript to change the image displayed on-screen and
                    change the text to say who won.
